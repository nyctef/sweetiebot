Moon fact: you can prepare a warding circle against woonish beings by mixing a powder of phosphorous, dried wolfsbane, and luna moth wings into a vial of filtered ram's blood. It won't actually do anything, but wasn't that a nice diversion? :lunawink:",

Instead, it is an unfathomable noneuclidean hypermatrix perpendicular to the warping fabric of reality. The brain merely interprets it as round to maintain your sanity and keep you from learning the truth. :woonafilly:",
