Why you shiny beetle! You quivering pall-o-dine of a sniveling Lighted Power! You plump kettle! I‚Äôll bring the all-encompassing powers of a thousand worlds crashing down upon your head!
Wie so siehst du so traurig aus? :sweetieeyes:
With a name like Smuckers, it has to smuck!
Witness me senpai!
Woe betide those who force Luna to log in
Wolfo knows and ignores
Wonderflonium: Do Not Bounce
Woomy!
Words are weapons, but weapons are also weapons.
Worried about the side effects? Rest assured, my autopsy is guaranteed to find out exactly what part of it killed you.
Would you say we'd be venturing into a ... zone of danger?
Wow. It's like "violent zen"
Wrestle with Jeff, prepare for death.

YOU, YOU, DOUBLE LEAF
Yahaha! You found me!
Yakyakistan, if you're listening...
Yeah, well, you're a cup of coffee!
Years are a scam invented by the calendar industry to sell more calendars.
Yes, but can it render fully uncompressed pixels? The highest quality pixels anybody has seen?
Yes, you do look fat in those clothes.
Yo have you heard of this ramen stuff? It's like soup but with chewy string in it!
You and me should making fuck BERSERKER
You are FAKE NEWS.
You are all ferrets
You are invited to become a moderator of /r/pyongyang.
You are not a clown. You are the entire circus.
You are now breathing manually :sweetiestare:
You break through the bushes back onto the path. Up ahead is what looks like an inn. If you listen closely, you think you can just make out some drunkly-shouted lyrics emerging from an open window ... '--with a giraffe, if you stand on a stool! But the hedgehog--'. Roll for perception.
You can do all kinds of cool things with a crowbar :sweetiestare:
You can log out any time you like, but you can never leave
You can walk with a prostetic leg, but you can't see with a glass eye. :sweetiestare:
You can't have nightmares if you never dream. :sweetie:
You can't piss on hospitality! I WON'T ALLOW IT! :fluttermad:
You can't treat me like that anymore. Dobby is a free elf!
You cannot analyse fun
You clod
You do not recognize the bodies in the water.
You don't deserve this big Toblerone...
You don't have your sea legs yet? Gotta trade in those B legs! :sweetieawesome:
You don't really understand a thing until you have eaten that thing.
You dont fuck with squirrels Morty!
You empty 'em dreamcatchers? They all full up. Yer mama ain't had a decent dream since yer sister went whitewater raftin'.
You ever drink Bailey‚Äôs out of a Cisco 2600?
You finish filling the casing with powder, reseat the bullet and load the last cartridge into the magazine. The magazine goes into the rifle; the rifle goes onto your back. With any luck this'll be another simple job, but part of you always wishes for a bit of excitement.
You gave WHO a superweapon?
You gaze at the unfortunate conflict of evidence arrayed on the table in front of you. You pick up the papers and slowly begin to shuffle them again, searching for some hidden link that would lead to the next clue. Roll for intuition.
You got mail!
You gotta up those "beh"s per day. Those are rookie numbers.
You had an arse full of farts that night, darling :sweetiepleased:
You had me at fist and lost me at fight. :sweetiebeh:
You have been banned from participating in /r/pyongyang.
You have been eaten by a grue.
You have been eaten by a woon.
You have won an extra baby!
You huddle closer to the library's only radiator, swapping your book and rapidly-cooling coffee between hands in a desperate attempt to stay warm. A noise makes you look up towards the entrance; there seems to be some sort of disturbance. Roll for initiative.
You huff a few kittens, build up a tolerance, and a month later they find you dead in your apartment with a fully grown tabby lodged in your wind pipe.
You huff a few memes, build up a tolerance, and a month later they find you dead in your apartment with a fully grown lolcat lodged in your wind pipe.
You just activated my trap card!
You just have to be a squid forever now. Accept it. Embrace it. Become one with the squid.
You know what else is mightier than the sword? A nuclear-tipped cruise missile.
You know what they say: it's better to die a hero than...get...sued. :sweetieoops:
You know what they say: you can't make a gyroelongated square bipyramid without dropping a few tiles!
You know what's metal? Pineapple. When you eat it, it eats you right back, bitch!
You know what, Oklahoma? You're OK. :sweetieidea:
You know, if we just got rid of all the laws the crime rate would be 0% :sweetieread:
You know...when you sit on a toilet you're connecting your butthole to a city-wide network of buttholes :sweetieread:
You look so lively. Did something good happen?
You may use pronouns, but only occasionally.
You must gather your party before venturing forth.
You need a vaccine so that the government can mind control you to SHUT THE FUCK UP.
You never go full Canadian
You no take candle!
You prepare a couple of Grease spells as you finish up your morning ritual. After that incident with the stoat, you can never be too careful.
You rage at the witch as she tells you your fortune. As you begin to calm down and accept your fate, you realise that a few of your comments have had a somewhat negative effect on her disposition towards you. You start to stammer out an apology. Roll for diplomacy.
You require more vespene gas
You seasonal watch begins. You are stationed at the remote Watchtower 9 in the high hills overlooking a small farming town and a large expanse of wild frontier. In the bottom of the valley below several leagues distant you can see the town. One night, the lights in town all go dark, as do the moon and stars after...
You see her dispatch two more mooks before heading in your direction. You're worried that if she sees you bleeding out like this, she's going to try and take care of you instead of finishing whatever she came here for. You shuffle back into the darkness, trying to make yourself as invisible as possible. Roll for stealth.
You should have been using Office 365‚Ñ¢¬Æ¬©
You should make like a Buddhist and set yourself on fire. :sweetiestare:
You sigh and fiddle with the car radio a bit more. It's only been half an hour, but you've already run out of things to look at or think about in the grey parking lot outside the car's dusty windows. The client had better arrive soon.
You sigh and grasp the handle firmly. The Door of Knowledge Through Which The Untutored May Not Pass sticks horribly in the damp, you're already half-soaked through from the rain and it's only a half-hour before the ritual is due to start. You just hope the greasepaper has kept the book dry. It would be a shame to have come all this way for nothing.
You slut, walking around like you want to consume that French onion soup. I bet you liked it.
You stand outside. There is a full moon. You are likely to be wooned by a woon.
You step back as your partner begins to chat up the next client. Your brain dimly follows the familiar patter while your eyes drift across the busy street, watching the neon signs and hovercar lights dance through the late night smog. Roll for perception.
You thread your way between a couple of crypts, trying to make as little noise as possible while pushing through the dark sand. The crypt on the right is particularly fine; the obligatory Sphinx statues painting Her in a particularly favourable light. People do mean well, but you know all the statues just make Her particularly annoyed with humanity.
You watch the early evening bar brawl wind down as the regular patrons decide they've had enough. A couple of unfamiliar faces are unceremoniously dumped out back, and your friend offers another round.
You're literally out of your mind if you think Dennys isn't a top. :sweetieread:
You're the guy with the things, and the thing that does that thing, and then you did that one thing!
You're walking in the woods. There's no one around and your phone is dead. Out of the corner of your eye you spot him...
You've always preferred preferred a grenade launcher to more conventional firearms. The way that the weapon makes a rather refined *thump* sound while all the ugly loud noises happen at a distance is particularly appealing. Jake thinks that your antique M79 collection is a waste of time, but he just doesn't appreciate beauty. The mook in the far corner thinks he's behind cover. You smile and load an explosive round into your little thumper, as you prepare to demonstrate just how wrong he is.
You've got mail!
Your body is not a torus; it is a bodysuit for a spider. :sweetiestare:
Your condescending, contradictory bullshit isn't attractive to anyone except your frothing, basement-dwelling, virgin army. :sweetiestare:
Your face looks extra angry in infra red!
You‚Äôve met with a terrible fate, haven‚Äôt you?
Yuri is the truest form of love
ZA WARUDO!
ZEN FIRE ZE MISSILES
Zeal is its own excuse.
Zeeky boogy doog. :sweetieawesome:
Zephy enjoys covering people in sticky white stuff and then lighting them on fire.
