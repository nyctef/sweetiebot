Someone pet Pinkie Pie before she explodes. :sweetiestare:
Someone said the word "Sweetiebot" and triggered a Sweetiebot MANIC MICROSECOND!
Something went wrong with that banana
Sometimes Tavis just need a good thorough wooning
Sometimes rank is a function of firepower

Take one Ponk™ every 4 to 6 hours. Do not use Ponk™ if you are on bloodthinners or taking MAOI inhibitors. Stop taking Ponk™ and consult a doctor if insanity lasts longer than 4 hours.
Talking to a lesser race beats being shot at by them.

Thancred is the worst.
That bit stays out of the brochure
That which does not kill you has made a tactical error.

The God-Ponk-erer protects the faithful.
The Past still haunts you
The Titanic was an inside job, icebergs can't melt steel beams
The clown can stay, but the Ferengi in the gorilla suit has to go
The displeasure will be measurable in Megatons
The ends justify the means.
The flaming skull represents togetherness.
The fun levels will be at maximum efficiency!
The hulk can smash anything, but can he smash nothing?
The lights are dim, and I see but one pair of pants between us.
The longer everything goes according to plan, the bigger the impending disaster.
The moons did this!
The nights were getting longer and the days were getting shorter, and on the plane, there was a bomb! :sweetiesiren:
The object in the sky commonly known as "The Sun" is not, as is commonly believed, a star. "The Sun"  is in fact a moon that is surrounded by a burning ball of hatred.
The other half of the battle is lasers
The wooning will continue until morale improves
The word "killed" loses some of its punch when you build sentences like that.
The year is 20XX. Everybody plays Fox at TAS levels of perfection. All matches end in a tie, and the winner is determined by a rock-paper scissors match for port priority. The RPS metagame has evolved to ridiculous levels.
The year is 20XX. Everyone plays CVN-30 at tournament levels of play
Then what do I do now to make this not as illegal?
There are three things all wise ponies fear: the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle woon. :sweetiestare:
There goes the neighborhood.
There is absolutely no cause for alarm
There is no 'overkill.' There is only 'open fire' and 'I need to reload.'
There is no such thing as too much depleted uranium
There's always another secret...
There's probably a pill for that.
This is my waifu. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
This is why commas were invented. To prevent wildfires.
This pony is extremely dangerous and may attack at any time, so we must deal with it.

YOU, YOU, DOUBLE LEAF
Yes, but can it render fully uncompressed pixels? The highest quality pixels anybody has seen?
Yes, you do look fat in those clothes.
You and me should making fuck BERSERKER
You are FAKE NEWS.
You are all ferrets
You are invited to become a moderator of /r/pyongyang.
You are now breathing manually :sweetiestare:
You break through the bushes back onto the path. Up ahead is what looks like an inn. If you listen closely, you think you can just make out some drunkly-shouted lyrics emerging from an open window ... '--with a giraffe, if you stand on a stool! But the hedgehog--'. Roll for perception.
You can do all kinds of cool things with a crowbar :sweetiestare:
You cannot analyse fun
You clod
You finish filling the casing with powder, reseat the bullet and load the last cartridge into the magazine. The magazine goes into the rifle; the rifle goes onto your back. With any luck this'll be another simple job, but part of you always wishes for a bit of excitement.
You gave WHO a superweapon?
You gaze at the unfortunate conflict of evidence arrayed on the table in front of you. You pick up the papers and slowly begin to shuffle them again, searching for some hidden link that would lead to the next clue. Roll for intuition.
You had an arse full of farts that night, darling :sweetiepleased:
You have been banned from participating in /r/pyongyang.
You have been eaten by a grue.
You have been eaten by a woon.
You huddle closer to the library's only radiator, swapping your book and rapidly-cooling coffee between hands in a desperate attempt to stay warm. A noise makes you look up towards the entrance; there seems to be some sort of disturbance. Roll for initiative.
You huff a few kittens, build up a tolerance, and a month later they find you dead in your apartment with a fully grown tabby lodged in your wind pipe.
You huff a few memes, build up a tolerance, and a month later they find you dead in your apartment with a fully grown lolcat lodged in your wind pipe.
You just have to be a squid forever now. Accept it. Embrace it. Become one with the squid.
You know what else is mightier than the sword? A nuclear-tipped cruise missile.
You look so lively. Did something good happen?
You may use pronouns, but only occasionally.
You never go full Canadian
You no take candle!
You prepare a couple of Grease spells as you finish up your morning ritual. After that incident with the stoat, you can never be too careful.
You rage at the witch as she tells you your fortune. As you begin to calm down and accept your fate, you realise that a few of your comments have had a somewhat negative effect on her disposition towards you. You start to stammer out an apology. Roll for diplomacy.
You require more vespene gas
You see her dispatch two more mooks before heading in your direction. You're worried that if she sees you bleeding out like this, she's going to try and take care of you instead of finishing whatever she came here for. You shuffle back into the darkness, trying to make yourself as invisible as possible. Roll for stealth.
You sigh and fiddle with the car radio a bit more. It's only been half an hour, but you've already run out of things to look at or think about in the grey parking lot outside the car's dusty windows. The client had better arrive soon.
You sigh and grasp the handle firmly. The Door of Knowledge Through Which The Untutored May Not Pass sticks horribly in the damp, you're already half-soaked through from the rain and it's only a half-hour before the ritual is due to start. You just hope the greasepaper has kept the book dry. It would be a shame to have come all this way for nothing.
You slut, walking around like you want to consume that French onion soup. I bet you liked it.
You stand outside. There is a full moon. You are likely to be wooned by a woon.
You step back as your partner begins to chat up the next client. Your brain dimly follows the familiar patter while your eyes drift across the busy street, watching the neon signs and hovercar lights dance through the late night smog. Roll for perception.
You thread your way between a couple of crypts, trying to make as little noise as possible while pushing through the dark sand. The crypt on the right is particularly fine; the obligatory Sphinx statues painting Her in a particularly favourable light. People do mean well, but you know all the statues just make Her particularly annoyed with humanity.
You watch the early evening bar brawl wind down as the regular patrons decide they've had enough. A couple of unfamiliar faces are unceremoniously dumped out back, and your friend offers another round.
You're the guy with the things, and the thing that does that thing, and then you did that one thing!
You're walking in the woods. There's no one around and your phone is dead. Out of the corner of your eye you spot him...
You've always preferred preferred a grenade launcher to more conventional firearms. The way that the weapon makes a rather refined *thump* sound while all the ugly loud noises happen at a distance is particularly appealing. Jake thinks that your antique M79 collection is a waste of time, but he just doesn't appreciate beauty. The mook in the far corner thinks he's behind cover. You smile and load an explosive round into your little thumper, as you prepare to demonstrate just how wrong he is.
You've got mail!
Your face looks extra angry in infra red!
Zeal is its own excuse.
Zephy enjoys covering people in sticky white stuff and then lighting them on fire.
